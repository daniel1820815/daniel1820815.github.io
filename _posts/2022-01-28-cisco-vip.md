For the first time in my career I was nominated as a Cisco Designated VIP! I felt really honored and proud to get the opportunity join a group of awesome and outstanding people. The Cisco Designated VIP program recognized the top contributors in Cisco's online communities known as the Cisco Learning Network and the Cisco Support Community. These VIPs earned this status by helping people in those online communities and sharing their knowledge and expertise. The experience and the quality of the Cisco Designated VIPs contributions is proofed and can be trusted.

I was taken into account because my contributions in the Cisco Learning Network over the last months on which I was heavily active in the Cisco Modeling Labs Personal and Cisco DevNet Certifications communities. It was so much fun to help other people with issues or getting familiar with the community, technologies, and tools. The Cisco Learning Network is a very helpful and kind community and I can highly recommend to join and contribute.
