The Cisco Live 2022 in Las Vegas was my first in the US after nine attendances in Europe so far. After almost two years of cancellations due to the pandemic it was so good to attend an in-person live event again. The indescribable feeling and value of meeting people face to face, talking (not only about technologies), joking, laughing, hugging, celebrating, and many more things is what matters for human beings. 

I had the great pleasure to meet a lot of my Social Media connections from LinkedIn and Twitter, and of course from the Cisco Learning Network and from the Cisco Champion group. It was a lot of fun and a pleasure to built even more close relationships and friendships with many people I only knew virtual until then.

My personal focus of technical sessions was pretty much dominated by topics around the Cisco DevNet Expert certification. After achieving the Cisco Certified DevNet Professional in June I started collecting information about the lab exam for the preparation journey. Therefore I booked a dedicated techtorial session, a related hands-on lab session and I spent a lot of time in the DevNet zone attending various workshops. 

By the way if you are interested in achieving the Cisco Certified DevNet Professional I wrote a knowledge base article which was published in the Cisco Learning Network about my [Road to the Cisco Certified DevNet Professional](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/Road-to-the-Cisco-DevNet-Professional){:target="_blank"}.

## Cisco Learning Network VIP's

One of my personal highlight aside the technical sessions was the VIP dinner of the Cisco Learning Network and Cisco Community. It was really a huge honor and a pleasure for me to be there. I had the chance to connect with the fellow VIP's and the team who build, maintain, and evolve this awesome community. Thank you very much!

## Cisco Champion Group

Also many thanks to the Cisco Champion organization team! They did a really awesome job to provide a lot of tours around the Cisco Live which gave us insights while the looking behind the scenes of the Cisco Live NOC, Cisco TV, DevNet Zone, Cisco Store, and many more. It was always nice to look over at the Champion's lounge and catch up with some fellows.

## See you in Amsterdam

The next Cisco Live event for me will be probably the [Cisco Live 2023 Amsterdam](https://www.ciscolive.com/emear.html) from February 6-10, 2023. I'm looking forward to see all the friends I made in Las Vegas again in Amsterdam and I hope that there will be more people to connect with. Until then, stay safe and healthy!
