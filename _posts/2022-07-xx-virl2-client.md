If you are using CML (Cisco Modeling Labs) to build labs for study or test scenarios there will come the time you think about automating tasks and using the CML API. I was recently playing around with CML creating a new lab for testing some [pyATS framework](ADD LINK){:target="_blank"} things. I came very quick to the point to use the official Python library [virl2_client](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/virl2-client){:target="_blank"} for CML to create a pyATS testbed automatically.

## Describe how it works with screenshots

I can highly recommend the blog post "[How can I automate device configurations using CML2?](https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/363-askhankcml2-01){:target="_blank"}" by Hank Preston which contains a very good introduction and explanation how to use it.

## Explain the issue

As I got a new laptop a month ago I have not installed all the tools I had before and also did not pull all the repository I was working on.  for testing from Github
