Recently I was playing around with Cisco Modeling Labs (CML) and creating a new lab for testing some things with [pyATS framework](ADD LINK). I came very quick to the point to use the official Python library [virl2_client](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/virl2-client) for CML to create a pyATS testbed automatically. I can highly recommend the Cisco blog post "How can I automate device configurations using CML2?" by Hank Preston which contains a very good explanation to use it.

As I got a new Macbook Pro some weeks ago I had to pull the repository I created for testing from Github
