If you are using CML (Cisco Modeling Labs) Personal or Enterprise to build labs for study or test scenarios there will come the time you think about automating tasks and using the CML API. I was recently playing around with CML creating a new lab for testing the [pyATS framework](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/pyats/#!introduction/cisco-pyats-network-test--automation-solution){:target="_blank"}. I came very quick to the point to use the official Python library [virl2_client](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/virl2-client){:target="_blank"} for CML to create a pyATS testbed automatically. During this process I stumbled over an issue which had an obvious solution.

## Explain the issue

As I got a new laptop a month ago I have not installed all the tools I had before and also did not pull all the repository I was working on.  for testing from Github

Github issue: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/virl2-client/issues/20


## Finally create your pyATS testbed

pyats validate testbed 

I can highly recommend the blog post "[How can I automate device configurations using CML2?](https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/363-askhankcml2-01){:target="_blank"}" by Hank Preston which contains a very good introduction and explanation how to use it.
