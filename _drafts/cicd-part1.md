In this SEVEN part blog post series I will go through the process of building a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for automated network configuration changes including pre and post validation. The pipeline will consist several components which will be prepared separately and be brought together in the end to a complete automated framework.

a OSPF configuration deployed using Ansible and validating the status of the network before and after the changes using pyATS test framework.

## Preparation

CentOS 9 Stream

Docker installation

## Components

### GitLab Docker container

### CML lab using Terraform

### Docker image creation

### Ansible for configuration

### pyATS for validation

### GitLab CI/CD pipeline
