I am talking about Software Design, Development, and Deployment

NOTE: Define scope of post (or posts) and add more introduction

Functional requirements: What the software should do!

Nonfunctional requirements: How a system should perform the functional requirements

NOTE: Add Examples

Importance of non-functional requirements

make maintenance much easier when prioritizing observability and modularity in the beginning of the application development

avoid technical debt and the potential cost of reworking or rebuilding a system. This will happen if you have chosen the fast and easy way without thinking about nonfunctional requirements. It will guide you to the dark side.

Dependant on specific cases you have to focus on the right nonfunctional requirements. For example for small-scale apps which are expected to grow quickly, you need to take scalability and extensibility more into account and put on top of your prioritization list than other requirements.
