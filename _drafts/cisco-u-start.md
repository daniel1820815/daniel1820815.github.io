Earlier this week it was announced that [Cisco U. is now available to everyone](https://blogs.cisco.com/learning/now-available-for-it-training-cisco-u?ccid=ciscou&dtid=web-cln-home&oid=parmerat-fy23-q4-0000-welcometociscou-ww){:target="_blank"}. There was an early access phase from last year on. I was lucky to get one early access and could test Cisco U. for some time. Now it is available for everyone for free until July 29, 2023. During that time there are is a special introductory pricing for your subscription afterwards.

The three different subscription plans **Free**, **Essentials**, and **All Access** are slightly different. **All Access** is clear, it gives you the full feature and digital content. A price of $6,000 ($4,800 with current discount) seems a proud price. The  **Essentials** plan takes only one feature away which is the *All self-paced hands-on labs* and but keeps the *Essential self-paced hands-on labs* feature which could be good enough for many students. Depending on your knowledge level, learning and certification goals the major drawback will be the missing *Professional-level certification Learning Paths* content within the **Essentials** subscription. More or less important in this context could also be the removed *Cisco product Learning Paths* and
*Cisco solution Learning Paths*. In my opinion the **Essentials** subscription looks good and with a price of $1,800 ($1,500 with current discount) per year seems to be a fair price considering the amount of content you get.

The **Free** plan consists the same features from the **Essentials** except the *Essential self-paced hands-on labs* and the digital content is limited to *Podcasts*, *Webinars*, *Tutorials*, and *Videos*. The missing opportunity to do self-paced labs could be a exclusion criterion, but one key point about the **Free** plan is the opportunity to earn *Continuing Education (CE) credits* from the content provided. Today it is really important to stay relevant in the industry and maintain your Cisco certifications.

I saw some critical discussions on Social Media about the prices of the subscriptions plans which I can understand to a certain point. The **All Access** plan seems too expensive for individuals in particular for young people or juniors who are at the beginning of their career. But the price is doable for companies supporting their employees. As I already wrote before, the **Essentials** plan has a fair price and I think investing $125-150 a month in yourself should be possible. It is an invest in yourself and your career. Many people often forget what an amount of work is behind providing high quality learning and training content. Everyone who has ever prepared a training session knows how much time and work you need to put in to create good content which brings a value to the attendees. The Cisco Learning & Certification team did a really good job with Cisco U. providing high quality courses, learning paths, or self-paced hands-on labs.

However there is always room for improvements, especially the user interface could be improved while you are in a course. Forward and backward navigation through the sections of a course and returning back to the course overview seems to me not quite intuitive. After spending some time with a course it's getting better because I have arranged with the navigation. The courses itself I was going through were a mixture between videos, reading, pre- and post-assessments, and
