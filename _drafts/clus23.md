Three weeks ago Cisco Live US 2023 in Las Vegas closed the doors. Now a save the date announcement for [Cisco Live US 2024](https://www.ciscolive.com/global/cisco-live-2024.html#:~:text=Cisco%20Live%20will%20be%20held,2024%20in%20Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada.){:target="_blank"} reached me and motivated me to write down six reasons to attend next years event. In 2024, Cisco Live US will be held again in Las Vegas, Nevada. Obviously there are many more reasons to attend but I want to highlight the most important ones to me personal. Feel free to use the comment section to add more reasons.

Besides the stressful traveling from Europe with an eleven hour flight (fortunately direct flights round trip for me) and managing the time difference of nine hours, Cisco Live US 2023 was again a real blast for me overall.

## My six reasons

### 1. The People

Cisco Live is all about the people and the people make this event to an awesome event. You will meet friends, coworkers, or ex-coworkers which you haven't see for some time. You will meet virtual friends from several social media platforms again or for the first time which is a great experience getting to know each other face to face rather than online. You will make new friends and get to know new business partners and much more. Don't miss the chance to book a Meet the Engineer (MTE) to connect and exchange with outstanding tech people from Cisco. The opportunity to meet and connect with people face to face is an underestimate value in live which can't be compensated using online meetings. Attend Cisco Live because of the people!

### 2. The Sessions

Breakouts, Broadcasts, Customer Success Stories, Demos, DevNet, Instructor-led Labs, IT Leadership, Innovation Talks, Keynotes, Partner Case Studies, Techtorial, Workshops or whatever session you booked, in very most cases you will not be disappointed about the content delivered to you. For the sessions I attended, I could see a slightly increase in the quality of contents and how the presentations were being held. I would like to highlight five sessions I attended which are from different session type:

- BRKATO-2106 - Ansible Network Automation, GitOps for NetOps

- DEVNET-3008 - Extending CML: Terraforming the Lost City

- DEVWKS-2033 - Hands-on HVAC Python SDK!

- CISCOU-3000 - The Future of Network Operations in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

- LTRCRT-3100 - Building Python Applications for DevNet Professional and Expert Candidates

### 3. The DevNet Zone

### 4. The World of Solutions

### 5. Learning & Certification

### 6. The Party
