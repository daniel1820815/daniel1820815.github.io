My name is Daniel Kuhl and I am working now for about 20 years in the IT industry. Here is a short overview of my career starting from my first steps with Information Technologies.

In 2000 I finished the technical college in electrical engineering and after nine month of military service I started my career. I started as an apprenticeship in 2002 as a classical Telecommunication Engineer for Deutsche Telekom. From 2005 to 2006 I was working for T-Systems within the Service Delivery Team responsible for leased-lines and different types of business circuits. During this time I started to transform step by step more into IT Networks and and also some IT Security.

After my time at T-Systems I started in 2006 studying information and communication technology and had a part-tome job at a small IT Network Consulting company. I gathered a lot of experiences during this time and earned the [CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/ccna){:target="_blank"} certification. Finally I became a Network Engineer, quit my study, and worked full-time for the small IT Network Consulting company in client projects. I developed quickly and became a CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional) in Routing & Switching, now called [CCNP Enterprise](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/ccnp-enterprise){:target="_blank"}, [Security](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/ccnp-security){:target="_blank"}, and later Design which was removed now.

In 2011, I was the Co-founder of [NSCON Network Services & Consulting GmbH](https://nscon.de){:target="_blank"} where I am still working in a dual position as CTO / CIO and Network Engineer on customer projects from various branches. I am trying to be a lifelong learner and share my knowledge with my Employees and the community and encourage all to do the same. I am holding several industry certifications, mostly Cisco as stated before, but I am always looking beyond the plate for other vendors in the field and being open-minded.

Driving technology innovations on all various parts of my daily job is my passion. Constantly evolvement, improvement, and further education are my daily expectations to myself. I try to bring that mentality to our company and motivate our employees to take this approach into account and evolve their knowledge and skills. Standing still is no option, but I am also a friend of a good work life balance. Only healthy and satisfied people are doing an excellent job.

Currently I am very focused on several topics related to IT Network Programmability and Automation. Beginning of 2021 I earned the [Cisco Certified DevNet Associate](https://developer.cisco.com/certification/devnet-associate/){:target="_blank"} certification and in November 2021 I took the [ENAUTO (Automating and Programming Cisco Enterprise Solutions)](https://developer.cisco.com/certification/devnet-en-auto/){:target="_blank"} exam. After a really hard study work I completed the [DEVCOR (Developing Applications Using Cisco Core Platforms and APIs)](https://developer.cisco.com/certification/devnet-core/){:target="_blank"} exam in June 2022 and became a [Cisco Certified DevNet Professional](https://developer.cisco.com/certification/devnet-professional/){:target="_blank"}. Now I am working on the preparation for the [Cisco DevNet Expert](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/devnet-expert){:target="_blank"} lab exam.
